#  Eniac Expansion Project- Data Analysis with Python

##  Overview

This project analyzes **Magist’s e-commerce data** to help **Eniac**, a European online marketplace for Apple-compatible accessories, evaluate the opportunity of expanding into the **Brazilian market**.

Originally completed during a Data Analytics Bootcamp (using MySQL), this version re-implements the project in **Python** to perform the same analysis and generate clear data-driven insights.

##  Business Context

**Eniac**, founded in Spain, has built a reputation for high-quality Apple-compatible tech products and friendly customer support.  
Now, it’s considering expansion into **Brazil** by partnering with **Magist**, a local SaaS company that connects small and medium stores with major marketplaces.

The main business questions are:

1. Is **Magist** a suitable partner for Eniac’s **high-end tech catalog**?  
2. Are **Magist’s delivery services** fast and reliable enough for Eniac’s customer standards?

Additional analytical questions were examined, including revenue trends, product variety and pricing, sales distribution across categories, delivery performance, and regional concentration of customers and sellers.

## Data

The dataset consists of several CSV files containing:
- Orders and order items  
- Products and product categories  
- Customers and sellers  
- Deliveries and payments  

These files represent a snapshot of Magist’s operational database.
Due to the large size of the data files, they have not been included in this repository.
The dataset was provided as part of the **Data Analytics Bootcamp on WBS Coding School**. The original source is not specified.

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, pgeocode)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Visualization for business insights**

## Results & Insights

1. Tech products represent around 14% of all items sold, showing that Magist’s catalog still mainly focuses on non-tech products.

2. Only 1.2% of total sales belong to expensive tech items, indicating a limited demand or availability for high-end products, a key factor for Eniac’s premium catalog.

3. 95.8% of orders are delivered on schedule, reflecting reliable delivery operations.

4. However, most deliveries take up to 7 days, which may not meet current customer expectations for fast shipping.


## Conclusion

Magist, with its current potential, could indeed be a valuable partner for Eniac. However, this partnership will likely require time and continuous effort to fully mature. If Eniac is willing to invest the necessary time and resources, the collaboration could yield positive outcomes in the long run.

It’s important to note that this analysis is ongoing, and the next phase will focus on the geographic concentration of Magist’s sales. This will help refine our conclusions further by identifying regional sales patterns and potential market strengths.
